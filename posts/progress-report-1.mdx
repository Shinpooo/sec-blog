# Introduction

The progress reports are a serie of articles where I will share my journey into the world of smart contracts security.


# Who am I?

Since this is the first report, I think a bit of context is needed.  
Here is a quick intro, I'm Pooshin, I'm a self-taught smart contract and I got into crypto in mid-2021. I learned a ton of stuff about web3, created some dApps & I worked as a fullstack web3 developer for many little projects. 


# What I learned?

Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

## Blockquotes

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

## Inline code

```
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

## Syntax highlighting

Here’s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/):

````
```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```
````

And here's how it looks - nicely colored with styled code titles!

```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```

## Footnotes

```
Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

- [ ] this is an incomplete item
```

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```
| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |
```

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

## Strikethrough

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like `~~this~~`) will appear ~~crossed out~~.
