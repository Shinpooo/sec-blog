# Introduction

The progress reports are a series of articles where I will share my journey into the world of smart contract security.
This progress report describes my journey from Sep 23, 2022 to Oct 2, 2022.

## Report format

I'm still thinking about how I should write those reports. I don't want it to be a chore. So for now, I'm keeping it simple & just dumping what is currently on my mind. But I'll probably come up with a better format as I publish more & more reports


# Who am I?

Since this is the first report, I think a bit of context is needed.

Here is a quick intro, I'm Pooshin, I'm an electrical eng & a self-taught smart contract dev. Got into crypto in mid-2021.<br/>
I learned a ton of stuff about web3, created some dApps & I worked as a full-stack web3 developer for many little projects. 
Smart contract & EVM are the parts I appreciated working on the most during my web3 journey. So I decided to get into it fully

# What did I work on?

## Slither

I watched the security [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/TmZ8gH-toX0) of Patrick Collins, which gave me a lot of resources to explore!

Learned about static analysis with Slither & applied it to some of my previous projects.

I then discovered one of my contracts (taken from this huge [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKJBEEXUha0)) was vulnerable.
I described the vulnerability I've found in this thread ðŸ‘‡

## CTFs

I then went to challenge myself to some CTFs to evaluate my current understanding of Solidity: [The Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) & [Damn Vulnerable Defi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/) which I highly recommend.

I am halfway through these challenges, and I can [solve](https://www.github.com/shinpooo) most of them so I think I can finish them by the end of next week.

Learned a lot through these CTFs and discovered many vulnerabilities I didn't know about, like the forced ether transfer when a smart contract `selfdestruct`.

I also learned how variables are packed in storage and how to access data even at a specific storage slot.


## Code4rena 

I discovered [code4rena](https://twitter.com/code4rena) & joined as a warden to take my hands on real audits. When I joined, [Art Gobblers](https://twitter.com/artgobblers) audit contest was running, so I spent some time just observing how auditors work, and which type of questions they ask the project owners. 

## Trail of Bits

I've also been applying to [Trail of Bits apprencticeship](the-road-to-the-apprenticeship). That might be a little early, but it doesn't cost anything to try! Their application process is a bit funny as it requires you to complete a little challenge on a test network.

## Blog

I also spent 1-2 days creating this blog, I wanted it to be fully customizable. It's built with Nextjs & MDX, so I don't have to write my posts in HTML but in MDX files which is much more convenient. 

It is super powerful as MDX allows you to write MD files with react components. For example, the tweets embedded in this article are React components. <Boop rotation={3600} timing={1000}>Also I will be able to do useless things like that (hover me!)</Boop>




# Plan for the next report

## Plan

Things I have to do
- Continue Ethernaut & DVD CTFs
- Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfFjUMPtsM0) 

Things I may (not) do
- Read audits
- Paradigm CTFs
- Understand Uni V3 codebase deeply
- Make my first audit contest at Code4rena
- Write technical content for the blog
- Improve the blog design

I like to not set large goals as I prefer exploring things when I discover them
