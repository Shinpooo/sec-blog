# Introduction

The progress reports are a series of articles where I will share my journey into the world of smart contract security.
This progress report describes my journey from Oct 3, 2022, to Oct 19, 2022.



# What did I work on?


## CTFs

I continued my progress on [The Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) & [Damn Vulnerable Defi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/).

I'm starting to feel comfortable now, I feel I can detect the vulnerabilities much more quickly than I used to. 

I posted all my solutions on [github](https://www.github.com/shinpooo).

I learned a lot of things about storage packing through those CTFs which made me want to build a tool (SOS32) for sub-optimal storage detection

## SOS32

SOS32? Yup, SOS stands for Solidity Optimize Storage & 32 for the limit of 32 bytes per storage slot. I won't go through all the details as it is a simple progress update, but you can find more info [here](https://github.com/shinpooo/sos32).

I wrote the codebase in python and I used nerdy stuff like mathematical optimization to make the thing work (probably not optimal tho).

There is still lots of improvement to be made, but the basis is there.



## leetcode 

<StaticTweet id="1582759140711051265" />

I've been applying for security roles at some auditing firms as I believe working in a company is also a very efficient way to learn. 

However, there are a few coding/security interviews I have to pass first. So I've been farming [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) questions for the last few days.

For someone who has not a computer science background, I find the questions kind of difficult as most of the questions are about algorithms & data structures you learn during your computer science degree.

I also read the first few chapters of [CTCI](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com).


## Andy Li videos

One night I was browsing youtube, looking for security content & I discovered Andy Li [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/AndyLi/videos). 

His content is truly inspiring as he followed a path similar to mine but a few months ahead of time. 

If you want to get into smart contract security, I highly suggest watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-469Gcye-ZE) of him.




# Plan for the next report


- Leetcode
- Read & understand some QA & Gas Optimization findings from Code4rena audit reports
