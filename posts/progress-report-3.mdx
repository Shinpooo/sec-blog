# Introduction

The progress reports are a series of articles where I will share my journey into the world of smart contract security.
This progress report describes my journey from Oct 19, 2022, to Nov 02, 2022.



# What did I work on?


## CTFs

For  CTFs, I focused those past days on DeFi CTFs, using uniswap v1 and v2 with the puppets challenges on Damn Vulnerable Defi

I got all my solutions on [github](https://www.github.com/shinpooo).


## Code4arena reports review


I started reviewing old reports from code4rena audit contests. These are very well-written and easy to understand. 

I think this is probably the best exercise to do when learning smart contract auditing as one can see the most common vulnerabilities happening on real projects.

I store every finding in a Notion and try to make categories for those findings. Doing this helps me a lot consolidate new security knowledge.

## First Audit contest

I also went through my first audit contest on Code4rena. It was Inverse Finance contest, a really cool project where you can lend tokens & borrow stablecoins at fixed rates.

My methodology was very simple, I did not want to get into the project from a developer perspective and try to understand the whole codebase. While I think this probably would be the best approach to search for code logic high vulnerabilities.

My goal here was to focus on one of my recent learnings and only that: ERC20 transfers mid and high vulnerabilities. I also keep track of my approach in a Notion section. Unfortunately, while I thought several times that I'd found something that might be vulnerable. Each time it ended up being secure!

## yAcademyDAO and NodeGuardians



I applied to [yAcademyDAO](https://yacademy.dev/fellowship-program/) fellowship program. This is a 1-month program where you audit (pre-)production codebases. I passed a little technical test and I am now waiting to know if I will be accepted.


I also applied to Nodeguardians Beta and have been accepted. Nodeguardians is not focused on security but it is very nice if you want to strengthen your solidity knowledge and it also has some CTFs. 
It has a gamified learning approach while you earn rewards by completing solidity quests. The quests are not for beginners but more for mid to advanced solidity developers.

# Plan for the next report


- Read Code4rena reports, participate in new contests
- Complete 1 more advanced CTF (Paradigm or another one)
